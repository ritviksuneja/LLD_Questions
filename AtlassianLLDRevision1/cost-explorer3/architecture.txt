‘ill cost them to keep using the product for the rest of the year
Your task is to develop a CostExplorer that calculates the total cost a customer has to pay in a unit year . 
This means that at any day of the year they should be able to get a provisional report giving monthly/yearly cost estimated.

CostExplorer should be able to provide a report of –

1)	Monthly cost (Generate a bill for each month, including bill amount for future months for the unit year)
2)	Yearly cost estimated(for the unit year)
