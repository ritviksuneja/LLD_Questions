Question 6) Cinema Screenings
Letâ€™s pretend we are in charge of a cinema. We want to figure out whether a new movie can be added 
to the existing schedule without removing any of the current movies

Note that:
The cinema opens at 10.00
The last possible end time for a movie is 23.00
Movie durations include setting up the room before the movie begins and cleaning it up afterward. 
In other words, if for example a movie ends at 14.00, the next movie can start at 14.00
Movie start times are expressed in minutes starting from midnight, so for example,10am would be 10*60 = 600


Cinema -> List<Schedule>
Movie -> duration
Screening -> movie, startTime

classes:

Movie:
    -name: String
    -duration: int //in minutes
    +getters()
    +constructor()

Screening:
    -movie: Movie
    -startTime: int //in minutes
    +getters()
    +constructor()
    +getEndTime(): int

Cinema:
    -schedule: List<Screening>
    -openingTime: int
    -closingTime: int
    +getters()
    +constructor()
    +addScreening(Screening screening): boolean

IllegalArgumentException
