Question 6) Cinema Screenings
Let’s pretend we are in charge of a cinema. We want to figure out whether a new movie can be added to the existing schedule without removing any of the current movies
Note that:
The cinema opens at 10.00
The last possible end time for a movie is 23.00
Movie durations include setting up the room before the movie begins and cleaning it up afterward. In other words, if for example a movie ends at 14.00, 
the next movie can start at 14.00
Movie start times are expressed in minutes starting from midnight, so for example,10am would be 10*60 = 600
Scale Up 1) 
Let’s add expected revenue per screening to each movie.
