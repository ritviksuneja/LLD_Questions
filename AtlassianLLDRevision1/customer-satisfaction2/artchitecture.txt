 Question 1)	Customer Satisfaction
a)	Imagine we have a customer support ticketing system. The system allows customers to rate the support agent out of 5. 
To start with, write a function which accepts a rating, and another which will show me all of the agents and the average ratingeach one has received, 
ordered highest to lowest.

Questions to ask:
1. The rating can be between 1 to 5, right? I am assuming integer as ratings.

Agent
RatingSystem -> accept rating, show all agents avg rating wise
Customer

Agent:
    -id: String
    -name: String
    -ratings: List<Integer>
    +getters()
    +constructor()
    +getAverageRating(): Double
    +addRating(): void

RatingSystem:
    -agents: Map<String, Agent> //<agentId, Agent>
    +constructor()
    +addAgent(Agent agent): void
    +addRating(String agentId, int rating) : void
    +getAgentsByAverageRating(): List<Agent>

Exceptions:
DuplicateAgentException
AgentNotFoundException
IllegalArgumentException

Tests:
1. Test happy scenario
2. Test agent not found Exceptions
3. Test duplicate agent found Exceptions
4. Test adding illegal rating
5. Test adding an agent with no id
6. Edge case 1 - Test only one agent
7. Edge case 2 - Test when there are no agents
