Imagine you are working on payments team at Atlassian. A customer subscribes to Jira and is interested in exploring how much it ‘ill cost them to keep using the product for the rest of the year
Your task is to develop a CostExplorer that calculates the total cost a customer has to pay in a unit year . This means that at any day of the year they should be able to get a provisional report giving monthly/yearly cost estimated.

CostExplorer should be able to provide a report of –

1)	Monthly cost (Generate a bill for each month, including bill amount for future months for the unit year)
2)	Yearly cost estimated(for the unit year)
