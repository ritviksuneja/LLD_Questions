we want to design a pub/sub system.
in a pub/sub system, there are publishers and subscribers.

subscribers subscribe to topics, and publishers publish to the topics. the message eventually is delivered to all of the subscribers of the subsequent topic.

if we talk about the entities, we would find out that there are a couple of them. namely:
topic, subscriber, publisher, message.

let's now draw the class diagram of such a system.

Topic:
    -name: String
    -subscribers: List<Subscriber>
    +subscribe(Subscriber subscriber)
    +unsubscribe(Subscriber subscriber)
    +publish(Message msg): void

Subscriber:
    -name: String
    -id: String
    +getters()
    +onMessage(Message msg): void

Message:
    -title: String
    -content: String

PubSubSystem:
    -topics: Map<String, Topic>
    +addTopic(String topicName): void
    +subscribe(String topicName, Subscriber subscriber): void
    +unsubscribe(String topicName, Subscriber subscriber): void
    +publish(String topicName, Message msg): void
