tic tac toe
design a tic tac to game bewteen two players.
the board is 3*3
the players can mark the squares either 'X' or 'O'.
the game ends in either of the three cases-
1. player1 wins
2. player2 wins
3. draw

board
position
player
game

board:
    -width: int
    -height: int

position:
    -x: int
    -y: int
    -value: char

player:
    -id: int
    -name: String

Game:
    -board: Board
    -values: List<Position>
    +move(int x, int y, char value)

the feedback is that the board should store cells rather than having a separate position class.
thus, let's build it like that from the next time.
