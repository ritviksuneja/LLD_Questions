snake and ladder

there are going to be 100 cells, each having a number, from 1 to 100.
there will be snakes and ladders spread across the board.
a cell will either have snake's head, snake's tail, ladder's starting point, ladder's ending point, or nothing.
we should maintain a list of ladders, and snakes in the game.
a player can roll a dice, and get a number between 1 to 6. the player must move the no they have got.
the player who reaches 100 first wins the game.
if the player is at 99, and he gets 1, he wins, otherwise, he doesn't.

we dont need to maintain the state at the board, right? or do we?
